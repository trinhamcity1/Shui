# Shui — Build Progress & Decision Log

A running record of what's been built, why, and what broke along the way. The
phase plan itself lives in [`prompts/README.md`](prompts/README.md); this file
is the narrative of actually executing it — read it if you're picking the
project back up and want context faster than re-reading every commit.

Updated as each phase progresses. Current state: **Phase 2 complete and
verified end-to-end on the real deployed backend** — video plays, quiz
runs, and the swipe-to-next-video paging is confirmed working.

## Phase status

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Foundation: strip the dead lesson engine, English-only, Firebase SDK, clean build | ✅ Done |
| 1 | Firestore model, security rules, Cloud Functions, R2 upload pipeline, seed content | ✅ Done — verified end-to-end on the real `shui-prod` project |
| 2 | Vertical video feed + end-of-video quiz + playback | ✅ Done — verified end-to-end on the real `shui-prod` project |
| 3 | Categories, topic pages, auth, profile, progress, likes, comments | Not started |
| 4 | AI tutor: grounded chat + proactive retention checks | Not started |
| 5 | In-app creator console: topics, uploads, quiz builder, publish controls | Not started |
| 6 | Browser dashboard for bulk authoring | Not started |

## Phase 0 — Foundation

Stripped everything left over from the app's previous identity (a bundled-content
Vietnamese citizenship tutor) down to a compiling, honest shell: three placeholder
tabs, the Firebase SDK wired up but unconfigured beyond `FirebaseApp.configure()`,
English-only, no simulated auth or fake subscription tiers left in to be mistaken
for real ones.

Verified by the user in real Xcode: clean build, all unit tests passing,
`FirebaseBootstrap` confirming it connects to the right project.

Real bugs hit and fixed during that verification pass:
- Missing `import SwiftData` in `ShuiApp.swift` — `.modelContainer(_:)` wasn't
  visible to the compiler without it.
- XcodeGen's package requirement syntax: `minVersion` needs a paired `maxVersion`
  to mean a range; `from:` is the correct key for "this version or later."
- `ShuiTests` target was missing `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE: YES` in `project.yml`,
  so running tests (the first time anyone ever had) failed code signing.

## Phase 1 — Backend

### What got built

- **Firestore schema** (`prompts/phase-01-backend.md` §1): categories, topics,
  videos, the `quiz/current` vs `quiz/answers` split (prompts+options are public;
  correct answers are owner/admin-only, enforced by security rules — grading
  never happens on-device), users and their subcollections (topicProgress,
  videoProgress with SM-2 state, likes, aiUsage), comments, reports, viewEvents.
- **`firestore.rules`** — deny-by-default, one row per collection, a rules test
  suite (`functions/test/rules.test.ts`) with **65 cases** run against a real
  Firestore emulator: a positive and a negative case for every row.
- **Cloud Functions** (`functions/`, TypeScript, 2nd gen, `us-central1`) — 14
  callables (`createVideoUpload`, `finalizeVideoUpload`, `createThumbnailUpload`,
  `saveQuiz`, `submitQuizAttempt`, `markVideoCompleted`, `toggleLike`,
  `setTopicVisibility`, `setVideoVisibility`, `softDeleteTopic/Video/Comment`,
  `claimHandle`, `assignRole`) and 4 triggers (`onCommentWritten`, `onUserCreated`,
  and two scheduled jobs — `cleanupOrphanedUploads`, `flushViewCounts`). SM-2
  scheduling ported verbatim from `SpacedRepetitionScheduler.swift` into
  `functions/src/lib/sm2.ts`, with a parity test asserting both implementations
  agree. 25 unit tests total (SM-2, the mastery formula, streak math, quiz schema
  validation).
- **R2 upload pipeline** — presigned PUT URLs minted server-side via
  `@aws-sdk/client-s3` + `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`; the client PUTs
  directly to R2, Firebase never touches the video bytes.
- **Swift repository layer** (`Shui/Sources/Data/`) — 9 repositories (Category,
  Topic, Video, Quiz, Progress, Social, User, Upload, and a protocol-only
  AITutor for Phase 4), each as protocol + live Firestore/Functions
  implementation + in-memory fake, held by one `AppEnvironment` injected at the
  root. Codable models mirror the Firestore schema with defensive decoding — a
  malformed document drops out of a page instead of crashing the fetch.
  `Sources/Data/` (plus `FirebaseBootstrap.swift`) is the only place allowed to
  import Firebase; enforced by `git grep "import Firebase"`.
- **Seed scripts** (`scripts/`, its own standalone `package.json`) —
  `seed_civics.ts` seeds the 11 fixed categories and one real topic (the
  official 2025 USCIS civics test, 128 questions, grouped into quiz-sized
  chunks), idempotent, skips the 8 questions whose answers depend on who
  currently holds an office or which state the learner lives in.
  `bootstrap-admin.ts` grants the first admin claim, breaking the
  chicken-and-egg problem where `assignRole` itself requires an admin caller.
- **Debug-only upload screen** (`Sources/Views/Debug/DebugUploadPipelineView.swift`,
  `#if DEBUG`) — the one sanctioned piece of UI this phase, proving the whole
  pipeline works: sign in / create account → create a test topic → pick a local
  video → `createVideoUpload` → PUT to R2 → `finalizeVideoUpload` → plays back
  in `AVPlayer`. Gets deleted or replaced once Phase 2 has a real upload flow.

### Verification

Self-verified in the build sandbox (no Xcode there, but Node + Java + the
Firebase emulator suite are): 65 rules tests, 25 unit tests, clean `tsc`,
`seed_civics.ts` run twice against the emulator with identical output
(idempotency confirmed).

Then verified for real, on the user's Mac, against the actual deployed
`shui-prod` project — including a real device upload through the full
pipeline. Confirmed working end to end on **2026-07-31**: a real video file
picked from Files, uploaded through a presigned R2 URL, finalized, and played
back from `https://pub-29f895ffbdcf49779204f67d1a69af9b.r2.dev/...` in
`AVPlayer`.

### Deployment gotchas (read this before touching `functions/` or redeploying)

None of these showed up in emulator testing — they're all real-deploy-only
failure modes, discovered by actually running `firebase deploy` for the first
time on this project. Worth reading before the next real deploy, since some of
these could recur when new functions are added in later phases.

1. **`firebase.json`'s functions `ignore` list included `"lib"`.** The
   predeploy step (`tsc`) correctly builds `functions/lib/` locally, but the
   packaging step that uploads to Cloud Build was told to exclude that exact
   directory — so every function's build failed with `lib/index.js does not
   exist`. Root cause: conflating `.gitignore` (correctly excludes `lib/` from
   version control, since it's a build artifact) with the *separate* deploy-time
   ignore list, which needs the opposite. Fixed by dropping `"lib"` from the
   ignore array.

2. **`.secrets.local.env` (real R2 credentials) was not excluded from the
   deploy upload.** Confirmed against `firebase-tools`' own source: once
   `firebase.json` sets an explicit functions `ignore` list, `.gitignore` is
   never consulted at all for deploy packaging — only that explicit list
   matters. The list only excluded `*.local`, not `*.env` files, so the real
   secrets file was very likely uploaded to Cloud Build during the failed
   deploy attempts above. Fixed by adding `*.local.env` to the ignore list.
   **Precaution taken:** the R2 API token was rotated afterward.

3. **Cloud Functions 2nd gen requires the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan.** The
   free Spark plan can't enable Secret Manager or deploy 2nd-gen functions at
   all. One-time project-level upgrade; free tier covers dev/test usage.

4. **The Firestore database itself was never created.** A Firebase project
   doesn't provision one automatically. Created manually via Console
   (Firestore Database → Create database → Production mode →
   `us-central1`) — must use the literal database id `(default)`, since
   nothing in this codebase (Admin SDK, client SDK) ever references a
   non-default database.

5. **`firestore.indexes.json` had an invalid single-field composite index**
   for `videoProgress.dueDate`. Firestore rejects composite indexes that only
   cover one field ("this index is not necessary, configure using single
   field index controls") — automatic per-field indexing already serves that
   query (`dueForReview` filters and orders by the same field, `dueDate`).
   Copied from the phase doc's suggested list without checking it against the
   actual query shape. Removed.

6. **New Cloud Run-backed callables weren't publicly invokable on first
   deploy** — every callable failed with `UNAUTHENTICATED` from the app, but
   Firestore rules-based writes worked fine, which was the tell: the rejection
   was happening at the Cloud Run/IAM layer, before the request ever reached
   application code (confirmed via `firebase functions:log`, which showed
   `The request was not authorized to invoke this service. The access token
   could not be verified.` — an infra-level message, not one of ours).
   Firebase is supposed to automatically grant public invoke access to
   callable functions at deploy time; that grant didn't take on this
   project's first 2nd-gen deploy. Fixed manually, once, via:
   ```sh
   gcloud functions add-invoker-policy-binding FUNCTION_NAME --region=us-central1 --member=allUsers
   ```
   applied to each of the 14 client-facing callables (not the 4
   trigger/scheduled functions, which are invoked by Google's own services and
   shouldn't be made publicly invokable). **If a brand-new callable added in a
   later phase gets `UNAUTHENTICATED` on its very first deploy, this is almost
   certainly why — check `firebase functions:log --only <name>` for that exact
   message before assuming it's an application bug.**

7. Two smaller ones, low-stakes: `HTTPSCallableResult.data` is a non-optional
   `Any` in the Swift SDK, not `Any?` — a `guard let` on it fails to compile.
   And macOS ships bash 3.2 (2007) as `/bin/bash`, whose parser can misread a
   variable name butted directly against a multi-byte Unicode character with
   no separator — caused an `unbound variable` crash in
   `functions/scripts/set-r2-secrets.sh` from a bare `$name…`. Fixed by bracing
   variables and sticking to plain ASCII in shell scripts going forward.

## Phase 2 — Feed

### What got built

The Learn tab: a full-screen, TikTok-style vertical video feed that ends
every video in a server-graded quiz.

- **`FeedPlayerPool`** (`Sources/Playback/FeedPlayerPool.swift`) — replaces
  the old `VideoPlaybackController`. A fixed ring of 4 pooled `AVPlayer`
  instances keyed by feed index (not video id), so scrolling never
  allocates or tears down a player mid-scroll. Handles prepare / activate /
  recycle / restart, KVO on item status and `isPlaybackLikelyToKeepUp`,
  end-of-item notification, a periodic progress observer, and
  `AVAudioSession` interruption handling (phone call interrupts playback,
  resumes after if the system says it can).
- **`FeedComposer`** (`Sources/Feed/FeedComposer.swift`) — the ordering
  algorithm, a pure function with no repository or network access (unit
  tested directly). Interleaves four buckets — due-for-review,
  continue-topic, new-in-interests, everything-else — in that priority
  order, but caps review items at 3 in a row and 4 per any 10-item window
  so reviews never dominate the session. Falls back to a plain review run
  only once every other bucket is exhausted. Dedups both within one call
  and across pagination batches via an `alreadyPlaced` parameter.
- **`FeedPageViewModel`** (`Sources/Feed/FeedPageViewModel.swift`) — one
  instance per video, owns the post-playback state machine:
  `notEnded → (loadingQuiz →) answering → submitting → (submissionFailed |
  revealing → result)`. Answers are collected locally per question and
  submitted once, at the end, in a single call — grading is entirely
  server-side, this client never sees a correct answer ahead of time.
- **`FeedViewModel`** (`Sources/Feed/FeedViewModel.swift`) — orchestrates
  everything above: pagination (mixed feed via `FeedComposer`, or a single
  topic's videos), prefetch/recycle against the player pool, view tracking
  (`viewEvents` + `markVideoCompleted`), like toggling, quiz submission,
  and a mastery-delta computation (diffs `topicProgress` before/after
  submit — the callable doesn't return this, so it's computed client-side).
- **Offline quiz-attempt queue** — `PendingQuizAttempt` (SwiftData model,
  answers round-tripped through JSON since SwiftData can't store
  `[QuizAttemptAnswer]` directly), new `PersistenceController` queue
  methods, and `NetworkMonitor` (`NWPathMonitor`-backed) triggering a flush
  the moment connectivity returns. A failed submission stays queued and
  retryable rather than silently dropped.
- **View layer** (`Sources/Views/Feed/`) — `FeedView` (the paging
  container, iOS 17 `ScrollView`/`LazyVStack`/`.scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)`),
  `FeedPageView` (one full-bleed page: video + status overlay + gradient
  scrim + progress bar + caption + right rail + tap-to-pause),
  `QuizCardView` (the slide-up overlay covering every state in the quiz
  machine), `FeedRightRail` (like / comments-placeholder / AI-placeholder /
  share, guest actions routed to a sign-in stub sheet), `FeedSheets`
  (video info, "coming soon" placeholders, sign-in stub), and
  `FeedEmptyStateView` (covers both "nothing published" and "caught up"
  with one adaptive view — the composer's due-item guarantee means an
  empty feed with a nonzero review count can't actually happen).
- Accessibility: Dynamic Type support (video caption capped at `.xLarge`,
  quiz card uncapped per the phase spec), `accessibilityLabel`/`Value`
  throughout the rail and quiz options, `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)`
  swapping the quiz card's slide transition for a cross-fade.
- **Explicitly out of scope this phase** (per `prompts/phase-02-feed.md`):
  real comments, the real AI tutor, categories/Explore, profile, creator
  tools, real sign-in. All represented by placeholder sheets/tabs that name
  the phase they land in.

### An architectural fix made along the way

`Page<T>.cursor` was `DocumentSnapshot?` — a Firebase type — which the new
feed pagination code would have had to touch outside `Sources/Data/`,
breaking the "Firebase imports confined to `Sources/Data/` +
`FirebaseBootstrap.swift`" rule from Phase 1. Caught before any view code
was written against it. Fixed by introducing an opaque `PageCursor` wrapper
(`Sources/Data/FirestoreSupport.swift`) that holds the snapshot without
exposing it — callers outside `Sources/Data/` can hold and pass one back
without ever importing Firebase themselves.

### Verification

**No Swift compiler exists in this sandbox** (unlike Phase 1, which had
Node + the Firebase emulator suite to self-verify against). Everything
here was checked by hand instead:

- Brace/paren balance counted per file — all balanced.
- A repo-wide grep for duplicate top-level type names — specifically
  re-checking for the exact bug class (`QuizOption` redeclared) that broke
  the Phase 1 build. None found.
- `import Firebase` confinement re-verified — still only `Sources/Data/`
  and `FirebaseBootstrap.swift` (plus the new `AppAnalytics.swift`, itself
  under `Sources/Data/`).
- No stray `DocumentSnapshot` reference outside `Sources/Data/`.
- Every repository/model call site in the new code cross-referenced by
  hand against the actual Phase 1 declarations (`Video`, `Quiz`,
  `QuizQuestion`, `QuizOption`, `QuizResult`, `QuizQuestionResult`,
  `TopicProgress`, `VideoProgress`, `UserAccount`) to catch signature
  mismatches before a real build would.
- Two new test suites written to satisfy the phase's own verify checklist:
  `FeedComposerTests` (8 tests: review-first ordering, the two spacing
  caps, the review-run fallback, dedup within and across batches,
  deterministic ordering, priority fallthrough) and
  `FeedPageViewModelTests` (12 tests: the no-quiz path, the quiz-still-
  loading race, single/multi-select toggling, `canAdvance` gating, full
  answer collection through submission, the reveal walk-through, retry
  after a failed submission, and `replay()`'s full state reset).

None of this substitutes for a real build. Real compiler errors are
expected here, same as Phase 1 surfaced two the emulator/self-review pass
couldn't have caught (`QuizOption` redeclaration, `HTTPSCallableResult.data`
being non-optional).

### Real-world debugging (after the first build)

Phase 2 built and ran cleanly (no compiler errors this time), but the Learn
tab showed "Nothing here yet" against the real deployed backend. Chasing
that down surfaced several real gaps, same pattern as Phase 1's deployment
gotchas — things no amount of self-review in this sandbox could have caught:

1. **There was genuinely no path to a public video.** `seed_civics.ts`
   creates its topic `private` (publishing is a Phase 5 feature), and
   `createVideoUpload` always starts a video `private` regardless of its
   topic. "Nothing here yet" was the correct response to zero public
   content, not a bug — but there was no way to *get* a public video for
   testing without Phase 5's creator console. Fixed by adding a
   `VideoRepository.setVisibility` and `QuizRepository.saveQuiz`, and a
   "4. Attach a quiz and publish" step to the debug pipeline screen
   (`saveQuiz` → `setVideoVisibility` → `setTopicVisibility`, in that order,
   since each precondition depends on the last).
2. **The feed never re-fetched after its first load.** `FeedView` only
   fetched via `.task`, which fires once per view identity — and `TabView`
   keeps every tab's content alive across switches, so publishing a video
   from the Debug tab and flipping back to Learn showed the same stale
   empty result. Fixed with `FeedViewModel.refresh()` (full pagination +
   player-pool reset) wired up as standard pull-to-refresh — this is normal
   feed UX regardless, not just a debug workaround.
3. **A failed fetch and a genuinely empty feed looked identical.**
   `loadError` was already being captured but nothing displayed it, so a
   real failure silently rendered as "Nothing here yet" — indistinguishable
   from there just being no content. Fixed with a distinct
   `FeedErrorStateView`. This is what finally surfaced gotcha #4 instead of
   another round of guessing.
4. **`videos(inTopic:)` was missing a composite index.** It filters on
   `topicId`, `status`, and `isDeleted` and orders by `order`, but
   `firestore.indexes.json` only had `{topicId, order}` — a leftover from
   before the status/isDeleted filters were added. The Firestore emulator
   doesn't enforce composite index requirements the way production does,
   so Phase 1's emulator-based self-testing never would have caught this
   either. Once surfaced (via gotcha #3's error screen — Firestore's own
   error message includes a direct link to create the missing index),
   audited every query in `Sources/Data/` and `functions/src/` against
   `firestore.indexes.json` rather than patching just this one: fixed the
   `videos(inTopic:)` index and proactively added one for
   `CategoryRepository.list()` (`{isActive, sortOrder}` — not yet called by
   any Phase 2 view, but the same missing-composite-index shape, and it
   will be the moment Phase 3's Explore tab lists categories). Every other
   query in both the Swift and Functions code was confirmed to either need
   no composite index (pure equality filters with no `orderBy`, or a single
   range/equality filter ordered by that same field) or already have a
   matching one.

**Requires `firebase deploy --only firestore` before this next build will
show real content** — this is an index-definition change, not app code.

### Confirmed working end to end

Verified live on **2026-07-31** against the real `shui-prod` backend, after
the index deploy: a published video plays full-screen, the end-of-video
quiz card appears and works, and — once a second video was published
through the debug flow — swiping up transitions cleanly to the next video,
confirming the pooled-player paging behavior (`FeedPlayerPool` activating
the new slot and pausing the old one) works as designed, not just in
isolated unit tests.
